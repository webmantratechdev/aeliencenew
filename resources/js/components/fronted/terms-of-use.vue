                            information related to and provides matching services for transactions in digital assets in
                            accordance with Article 24 of this Agreement. The Platform is only responsible for reviewing
                            the text of information released by the digital asset project owners, and does not guarantee
                            or assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or legality of such information.
                            The Users shall make decisions based on their independent judgment and shall engage their
                            own advisors and/or conduct their own research. If Users conduct digital asset transactions

                    <p>Article 26&nbsp;The digital asset trading services mentioned under Article 24 of this Agreement
                        shall include the following:</p>
                    <p>(1)&nbsp;User Accounts: a User account will be generated upon a User&rsquo;s registration with
                        the Platform. The User account will record the User's activities on the Platform. The
                        above-mentioned User account is the only account for the User to log on to the Platform.</p>
                    <p>(2)&nbsp;Digital asset trading: Users can submit digital asset trading instructions through the
                        Platform and trade other digital assets with digital assets in their User accounts.</p>
                    <p>(3)&nbsp;Digital assets deposit and withdrawal: a User can transfer digital assets from other
                        addresses to designated addresses in the User&rsquo;s account, or transfer digital assets from
                        the User&rsquo;s account to other addresses.</p>
                    <p>(4)&nbsp;Updating trading status: the User confirms that the digital asset trading status
                        confirmed by the User in accordance with the Platform services procedures on the Platform will
                        become an irrevocable instruction for the Platform to conduct relevant transactions or
                        operations for the User. The User agrees that the execution time of relevant instructions shall
                        be based on the actual operation time of the Platform in the Platform system. The User agrees
                        that the Platform has the right to handle relevant matters in accordance with this Agreement
                        and/or the relevant dispute resolution rules of the Platform. Any dispute or loss caused by
                        User&rsquo;s failure to amend or confirm the transaction status, or to submit relevant
                        applications in a timely manner, shall be borne by the User exclusively, and the Platform shall
                        not bear any responsibility whatsoever.</p>
                    <p>(5)&nbsp;Transmission of trading instructions: the Platform transmits the User&rsquo;s trading
                        instructions at the time the User inputs the trading instructions and data. The User understands
                        that the Platform is the matchmaker of digital asset transactions, not a buyer or seller
                        participating in the transaction of digital asset transactions itself, and that the Platform
                        does not provide any services relating to the deposit or withdrawal of the legal tender of any
                        country.</p>
                    <p>(6)&nbsp;Transaction inquiry: the Platform will record all of the User's operations on the
                        Platform, regardless of whether the purpose of such operations is finally achieved. The User can
                        query such transaction records under the User&rsquo;s account in real time via such User&rsquo;s
                        account.</p>
                    <p>(7)&nbsp;Transaction security settings: the Platform has the right to carry out the settings of
                        transaction-related matters from time to time based on considerations of such factors as
                        transaction security, including transaction limits and transaction times,&nbsp;<em>inter
                            alia</em>. The Users understand that the aforesaid settings of the Platform may cause
                        certain inconveniences in trading, and the Users have no objection thereto.</p>
                    <p>(8)&nbsp;Handling of system failures: if the Platform uncovers a handling error caused by a
                        system failure or any other reason, the Platform has the right to correct the error regardless
                        of whether it is beneficial to the Platform or its Users. Where due to such error, the User
                        actually receives more digital assets than the amount that such User should have received, then
                        regardless of the nature and reason of the error, the Platform reserves the right to correct
                        such improperly executed transaction and the User shall return the overcharged digital assets or
                        perform other operations in accordance with the specific requirements of the Platform's notice
                        to the User regarding the correction of such error. The User understands and agrees that the
                        Platform will not assume any losses or responsibilities caused by the aforesaid handling error.
                    </p>

                        technical services announced by the Platform, the Platform cannot provide any investment, legal,
                        taxation or other professional opinions to the Users in connection with digital asset
                        transactions. Moreover, any information, discussion, analysis, price and other information
                        provided by any Platform are general comments and do not amount to advice to the Users in
                        connection with any digital asset transaction. A User that needs any professional advice should
                        consult relevant professionals for professional advice on investment, law, taxation or other
                        professional advice related to digital cash transactions. The Platform does not assume any
                        direct or indirect losses (including any loss of profits) caused by a User's reliance on the
                        above-mentioned general comments.</p>

                        offers to Users in any country or region that determines that the services provided by the

                        accordance with the digital asset trading information input by the User. The User acknowledges
                        and agrees that when there is a digital asset transaction that meets the User's entrusted
                        transaction price, the Platform will automatically complete the transaction matching without

                        right to revoke or amend the entrustment at any time before the digital asset transaction

                    <p>(4)&nbsp;any other justifiable reason.</p>
                    <p>Article 31&nbsp;If the Platform modifies, suspends or permanently terminates some or all of the

                        negligence on the part of the User, the Platform will not assume any responsibility whatsoever;

                        responsibilities arising from such use shall be borne by the User exclusively. Furthermore, the
                        User understands that the Platform needs a reasonable period of time to take action on the
                        User's request; the Platform shall not be held liable for any loss that may arise in connection
                        with such third person&rsquo;s use of the services before the Platform takes action.</p>

                        information of any other person that the User uses without due authorization, or the information
                        provided by the User for verification is inconsistent with relevant facts;</p>

                        Platform believes are risky or unlawful;</p>
                    <p>(4)&nbsp;the Platform discovers that the User uses any illegal or improper technical means to

                    <p>Article 36&nbsp;When a User decides to cease to use his/her/its User account, the User shall
                        first pay off all outstanding payables (including service fees, inter alia), then withdraw all
                        available digital assets (if any) from the User account that are eligible for withdrawal, apply
                        to the Platform for freezing the User account, and formally cancel the User account upon

                    <p>Article 37&nbsp;The User agrees that if the identity verification procedure for his/her/its User

                        Platform has the right to terminate the supply of User account services without prior notice to
                        the User, and the Platform may promptly suspend, close or delete the User account and all

                    <p>Article 38&nbsp;The User agrees that the suspension, interruption or termination of the User's
                        account does not represent the termination of the User's responsibilities. The User shall still
                        be liable for any possible breach of agreement or damages that may arise due to or in connection
                        with such User&rsquo;s conduct during the time when such User uses the services provided by the
                        Platform; furthermore, the Platform may continue keeping relevant information of the User.</p>

                        be held liable for such loss in any manner whatsoever.</p>

                        breach of the guarantees or undertakings hereunder) or infringement. In addition, even if the
                        exclusive relief provided in this Agreement does not achieve its basic purpose, the Platform
                        shall also be excluded from any liability for the above losses.</p>
                    <p>Article 56&nbsp;Unless this Agreement stipulates otherwise, under any circumstances, the total

                        non-breaching party. Therefore, the Users agree that the Platform has the right to seek
                        injunctive remedies and all other remedies permitted by common law or equity in the event of
                        breach or possible breach of agreement by the other party to this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>(3)&nbsp;default risks: Users may suffer losses due to the inability or unwillingness of the
                        project owner to carry out or continue carrying out their project;</p>
                    <p>(4)&nbsp;risks related to earnings: digital assets are not issued by any financial institution or
                        platform, and the digital asset market is a brand new and unconfirmed market that may not
                        generate actual increase in earnings;</p>
                    <p>(5)&nbsp;trading risks: digital assets are mainly used by speculators, and are used relatively
                        less in retailing and commercial markets; the trading of digital assets involves an extremely
                        high level of risk because trading of digital assets goes on uninterrupted throughout the day
                        without any limits on the ups and downs, and therefore prices are subject to large fluctuations
                        caused by traders and/or global government policies;</p>
                    <p>(6)&nbsp;risks caused by&nbsp;<em>force majeure</em>&nbsp;factors;</p>
                    <p>(7)&nbsp;User's fault: any and all losses caused by the Users&rsquo; fault, including loss caused
                        by wrong decision-making, improper operation, forgetting or revealing passwords, deciphering of
                        passwords by others, third-party intrusion into computer systems used by the Users, and
                        malicious or improper operation by a third party entrusted by the Users to serve as their agent.
                    </p>
                    <p>Article 62&nbsp;Digital asset transactions are extremely risky and are therefore not suitable
                        investments for most people. The Users know and understand that part or all of their investment
                        in digital asset trading may be lost, so the Users should determine the amount of their
                        investment or transactions based on the extent of losses they can afford. In addition to the
                        risks indicated under Article 61 of this Agreement, there will also be risks that cannot be
                        predicted. Therefore, the Users should carefully assess their financial situation and various
                        risks before making any decision on investment in or transaction of digital assets. The Users
                        shall bear any and all losses arising from their decision, and the Platform shall not bear any
                        responsibility for Users' investment or trading decisions.</p>
                    <p>Article 63&nbsp;In view of the risks arising from digital asset investment or transaction, if a
                        User has any doubts as to such investment or transactions, the User should seek the assistance
                        of professional consultants prior to transaction or investment.</p>
                    <p>Article 64&nbsp;The Platform does not provide any guarantee or condition to any User and/or any
                        transaction, whether express, implied or statutory. The Platform cannot and does not attempt to
                        control the information released by Users or project owners. The Platform does not undertake any
                        form of certification and authentication services for such information. The Platform cannot
                        fully guarantee the authenticity, sufficiency, reliability, accuracy, integrity and validity of
                        all content on the Platform, and does not need to bear any legal responsibilities arising
                        therefrom. The Users should base their transaction on their own independent judgment and assume
                        full responsibility for their own judgment.</p>
                    <p>Article 65&nbsp;The Platform does not make any express or implied guarantee for its Users to use
                        the Platform services, including but not limited to the applicability, absence of errors or
                        omissions, continuity, accuracy, reliability and suitability for a particular purpose.
                        Furthermore, the Platform does not make any undertaking and guarantee in connection with the
                        validity, accuracy, correctness, reliability, quality, stability, integrity and timeliness of
                        the technologies and information involved in the services provided by the Platform.</p>
                    <p>Article 66&nbsp;Whether to log into the Platform or use the services provided by the Platform is
                        the personal decision of individual Users, who shall exclusively bear any and all risks and
                        possible losses that may arise from such decision. The Platform does not make any express or
                        implied guarantee in connection with the market, value and price of digital assets. The Users
                        know and understand the instability of the digital asset market. The price and value of digital
                        assets may fluctuate significantly or collapse at any time. Engaging in digital asset
                        transaction is the free choice and decision by individual Users, who shall exclusively bear the
                        risks and possible losses that may arise.</p>
                    <p>Article 67&nbsp;The above clauses do not reveal all the risks and market situations that the
                        Users may be subject to when they engage in transactions through the Platform. Before making a
                        decision relating to transaction, the Users should fully understand the relevant digital assets,
                        adopt a cautious approach to decision-making based on their own transaction objectives, risk
                        tolerance capacity and asset status, and assume all risks exclusively on their own.</p>
                    <p>Article 68&nbsp;Under any and all circumstances, the third party shall be responsible for the
                        services that are provided by such third party and are involved in the Users&rsquo; use of the
                        Platform services, and the Platform shall not bear such responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Article 69&nbsp;Any loss or liability caused by factors attributable to a User shall be borne by
                        such User exclusively and the Platform shall not be held liable in any manner whatsoever.
                        Circumstances under which the Platform shall not be held liable include:</p>
                    <p>(1)&nbsp;where any loss or liability is caused by the User's failure to operate in accordance
                        with this Agreement or any rules published by the Platform from time to time;</p>
                    <p>(2)&nbsp;where any loss or liability is caused by any uncertainty, ambiguity or incompleteness in
                        the instruction information sent by the User to the Platform;</p>
                    <p>(3)&nbsp;where any loss or liability is caused by insufficient balance of digital assets in the
                        User's account;</p>
                    <p>(4)&nbsp;where any losses or responsibilities is caused by any other factor attributable to the
                        User.</p>
                    <p><strong>Chapter 11 Service Fees and Other Fees</strong></p>
                    <p>Article 70&nbsp;If a User uses the Platform services, the Platform will charge relevant Platform
                        service fees on the User. Each item of Platform service fee shall be subject to the description
                        and rates of fees listed on the Platform when the User uses the Platform services. The Platform
                        reserves the right to unilaterally formulate and adjust the rates of the Platform services fees.
                    </p>
                    <p>Article 71&nbsp;The Users may have to pay to third parties a certain third-party service fee in
                        connection with their use of the Platform services. For the specific rates of such third-party
                        service fees, please refer to relevant web pages of the Third-party Websites, or the Platform's
                        reminders and fee rates. The Users agree to pay such service fees to the third parties on their
                        own or by entrusting the Platform or a third party designated by the Platform according to the
                        aforementioned rates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Chapter 12 Termination of Agreement</strong></p>
                    <p>Article 72&nbsp;Users have the right to apply to the Platform for cancellation of their accounts
                        with the Platform at any time in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If the
                        Platform cancels the account of a User in accordance with Article 36 of this Agreement, this
                        Agreement will be terminated as of the date when the Platform approves the User&rsquo;s
                        application for account cancellation.</p>
                    <p>Article 73&nbsp;Where an account is canceled in accordance with Articles 36 and 37 of this

                    <p>Article 74&nbsp;If a User deceases or is declared dead, all the rights and obligations thereof
                        under this Agreement shall be borne by the successor thereof. If a User loses all or part of
                        his/her/its capacity for civil rights or civil conducts, the Platform or its authorized subject
                        has the right to dispose of the funds related to the User's account in accordance with valid
                        legal documents (including effective court judgments, inter alia) or instructions from the legal
                        guardian of such User. If the successor or legal guardian of the User decides to continue
                        performing this Agreement, this Agreement shall remain valid; otherwise, the successor or legal
                        guardian of the User shall apply to the Platform for cancellation of the account number in
                        accordance with Article 35 of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be terminated from the
                        date when the Platform approves the cancellation of the account of the User.</p>
                    <p>Article 75&nbsp;The Platform shall have the right to terminate all services of the Platform in
                        accordance with this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate on the date of termination of all

                    <p><strong>Chapter 15 General Provisions</strong></p>
                    <p>Article 92&nbsp;This Agreement is jointly signed by the Users and the Platform and is applicable
                        to all activities of the Users on the Platform. The content of this Agreement includes the terms
                        and conditions of the main body of the Agreement and various rules that have been issued or may
                        be issued in the future. All the terms, conditions, and rules are an integral part of this
                        Agreement and shall have the same legal effect as the main body of this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>Article 93&nbsp;If any term or condition of this Agreement is deemed to be unenforceable, invalid
                        or illegal by any competent authority, the validity of the other terms and conditions of this
                        Agreement shall not be affected.</p>
                    <p>Article 94&nbsp;The rights and obligations agreed on in this Agreement shall also be binding on
                        the transferees, heirs, executors and administrators of all parties hereto that have obtained
                        benefits from the rights and obligations through transfer or assignment of such rights and
                        obligations. The Users may not transfer their rights or obligations under this Agreement to any
                        third party without the consent of the Platform, but the Platform may transfer its rights and
                        obligations under this Agreement to any third party at any time, with a notice to the Users
                        thirty (30) days prior to the transfer.</p>
                    <p>Article 95&nbsp;If any term or condition in this Agreement becomes totally or partially invalid
                        or unenforceable for any reason, it shall be deemed that the term or condition can be separated
                        from this Agreement and replaced by a new and effective term or condition that is as close as
                        possible to the intentions of the parties and that can preserve the economic purposes required
                        by this Agreement. Moreover, in this case, the other terms and conditions of this Agreement
                        shall remain fully valid and binding.</p>
                    <p>Article 96&nbsp;Unless it is otherwise agreed in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall
                        be deemed to have created, implied or otherwise treated the Platform as an agent, trustee or
                        other representative of the Users.</p>
                    <p>Article 97&nbsp;The failure of either party hereto to exercise any of the rights thereof
                        hereunder or seek remedies in connection with a single event does not affect the subsequent
                        exercise of such rights or seeking of remedies in connection with such event or other events.
                    </p>
                    <p>Article 98&nbsp;Waiver of breach of agreement or waiver of any term or condition of this
                        Agreement shall take effect only after the non-breaching party or the party that does not seek
                        such waiver signs in writing to agree to the waiver. Any waiver of breach of agreement under
                        this Agreement cannot be deemed or interpreted as an exemption of the non-breaching party from
                        any subsequent breach of agreement or other breach of agreement. Failure to exercise any right
                        or remedy shall not be construed as a waiver of such right or remedy in any way.</p>
                    <p>Article 99&nbsp;This Agreement is concluded in accordance with the laws of the Republic of
                        Seychelles, and its establishment, interpretation, content and performance shall be governed by
                        the relevant laws and regulations of the Republic of Seychelles. Any claim or lawsuit arising
                        out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced by the laws of the
                        Republic of Seychelles.</p>
                    <p>Article 100&nbsp;Unless otherwise agreed by other rules under this Agreement, both parties agree
                        that any claims or lawsuits arising from or related to this Agreement shall be submitted to the
                        Singapore International Arbitration Commission for arbitration.</p>
                    <p>Article 101&nbsp;This Agreement shall enter into force when the Users obtain their account with
                        this Website, and shall be binding on the Users and this Platform.</p>
                    <p>Article 102&nbsp;The ultimate power to interpret this Agreement shall be vested in this Platform.
